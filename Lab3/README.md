# Notes

* Notebooks 0 and 1 are weights and biases tutorials. They can be also accessed from the following links:

* Notebook 2 is a demonstration of LSTMs and hyperparameter tuning for a real task. The data for it is included in the repo as a .csv file.

* Notebook 3 is an edited version of a huggingface tutorial. Many things can be done without huggingface functions, as it abstracts away too much detail. In the lab training with native pytorch part is covered, and it is the recommended way. There are also code blocks on freezing certain layers to ease fine-tuning, as well as adding a layer of our own into a pre-trained model. The original version can be accessed from the following link:
